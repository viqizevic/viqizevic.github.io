# Liverpool secure their first Premier League title

Jurgen Klopp's team are confirmed as the 2019/20 champions after Chelsea beat Man City at Stamford Bridge

Liverpool have won their first Premier League title, after Chelsea's 2-1 win over Manchester City on Thursday guaranteed them the Trophy.

The Reds's 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday night extended their lead in the table to 23 points, forcing their nearest pursuers Manchester City to have to win at Stamford Bridge to keep the title race alive.

With seven matches still to play, Jurgen Klopp's team have beaten the record for winning a title with five matches to spare, which was jointly held by Manchester United in 2000/01, and Man City's 2017/18 side.
