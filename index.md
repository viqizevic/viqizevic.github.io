# Liverpool secure their first Premier League title

Jurgen Klopp's team are confirmed as the 2019/20 champions after Chelsea beat Man City at Stamford Bridge

Liverpool have won their first Premier League title, after Chelsea's 2-1 win over Manchester City on Thursday guaranteed them the Trophy.

The Reds's 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday night extended their lead in the table to 23 points, forcing their nearest pursuers Manchester City to have to win at Stamford Bridge to keep the title race alive.

With seven matches still to play, Jurgen Klopp's team have beaten the record for winning a title with five matches to spare, which was jointly held by Manchester United in 2000/01, and Man City's 2017/18 side.

Liverpool, who ended a 30-year wait to be England's top-flight champions for the 19th time, will become the seventh club to lift the PL Trophy, after Man Utd, Blackburn Rovers, Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City and Leicester City.

## Which records have they set?

* Best start ever - When Liverpool reached 61 points from their opening 21 matches, it was the most a team had ever accumulated at that stage in any of Europe's top five leagues. They went on to extend their record, winning their following six fixtures to rack up 79 points from their first 27 matches before losing at Watford.
* Most points won over 38 matches - With their 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur on 11 January, Liverpool set a record of 104 points from 38 Premier League matches, beating the 102 achieved by Manchester City and Chelsea, ending in 2018 and 2005 respectively.
* Biggest lead at the top - Liverpool have had a 25-point lead this season, the biggest ever in English top-flight history.
* Most home wins in a row - Liverpool's 3-2 victory over West Ham United on 24 February was their 21st consecutive Premier League home win, beating Man City's record of 20, achieved between 2011 and 2012. They have since extended this record to 23 with the wins over AFC Bournemouth and Crystal Palace at Anfield.
* Earliest title win - By claiming the title with seven matches to spare Liverpool beat the mark set of becoming champions with five matches remaining, set by Man Utd in 2000/01, and Man City in 2017/18.
